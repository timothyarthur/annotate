This is a WiP [minimal computing](https://github.com/minicomp/) proof-of-concept for creating IIIF annotations without needing to stand up an annotation server. The goal is to provide a static site template for an annotation UI that can be hosted pretty much anywhere (including by GitHub pages!) and will allow scholars to annotate IIIF manifests. 

They can then download their work as a `.zip` from their browser's local storage and ingest the annotations themselves locally or pass the `.zip` along to librarians/technologists as part of their workflow‚Äîall without anyone needing to deploy or maintain an application.

Ultimately, this should work alongside the [Minicomp/Wax framework](https://github.com/minicomp/wax/) for producing minimal IIIF exhibitions.
